<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

<p style="color: red;">For editor's use only.  Please do not edit this section.</p>

<p>??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
The editor will add this section.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>??? abstract, preferably shorter than 200 words.  Please outline the
need for, and design of, the proposal.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>??? detailed rationale.  This should be 200-500 words long.  Please
explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a standard feature
in Scheme implementations.  List related standards and SRFIs,
including dependencies, conflicts, and replacements.  If there are
other standards which this proposal will replace or with which it will
compete, please explain why the present proposal is a substantial
improvement.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>The <dfn>immediate continuation</dfn> of an expression is that part
of the expression's continuation that is delimited by

<p>Like a variable, a <dfn>liquid</dfn> is an identifier naming a location.  Whenever a continuation is </p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>&langle;liquid&rangle;</b></p>

<p>An expression consisting of a liquid is a liquid reference.  The
value of the liquid reference is the value stored in the location to
which the liquid is bound.</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>set!</b> <b>&langle;liquid&rangle;</b></p>

<p>The <code>&langle;expression&rangle;</code> is evaluated, and the
resulting value is stored in the location to
which <code>&langle;liquid&rangle;</code> is bound.</p>

<p><u>Definition:</u> <b>define-liquid</b> <var>&langle;liquid&rangle;</var> [<var>expression</var>]</p>

<p>This definition binds <var>&langle;liquid&rangle;</var> to a new location before assigning the value of <var>expression</var> to it.</p>

<p>Outside the continuation of <var>expression</var>, <var>&langle;liquid;&rangle</var> must not
be assigned or referred to.  If this restriction is violated, an
exception with condition type <code>&assertion</code> is raised.
Another restriction is that the continuation of
&langle;expression&rangle; should not be invoked more than once.
Implementations may or may not detect that the continuation
of <var>expression</var> is invoked more than once.  However, if the
implementation detects this, it must raise an exception with condition
type <code>&assertion</code>.</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>let-liquid</b> ...</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>liquid-let</b> ...</p>


<p>Please include examples.  They make it much easier for readers to
understand your proposal.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>A portable R<sup>6</sup>RS or R<sup>7</sup>RS Small implementation
is not possible.</p>

<p>The sample implementation is provided as
an <a href="https://github.com/mnieper/ChezScheme/tree/liquids">extension</a> to Chez Scheme.</p>
