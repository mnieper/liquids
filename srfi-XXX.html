<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

<p style="color: red;">For editor's use only.  Please do not edit this section.</p>

<p>??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
The editor will add this section.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>??? abstract, preferably shorter than 200 words.  Please outline the
need for, and design of, the proposal.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>??? detailed rationale.  This should be 200-500 words long.  Please
explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a standard feature
in Scheme implementations.  List related standards and SRFIs,
including dependencies, conflicts, and replacements.  If there are
other standards which this proposal will replace or with which it will
compete, please explain why the present proposal is a substantial
improvement.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>Each continuation eventually extends a <dfn>primordial
continuation</dfn>.  Each primordial continuation has a <dfn>liquid
environment</dfn>, a set of bindings from <dfn>liquid locations</dfn>
to values.  The liquid environment of the primordial continuation of
the current continuation is the <dfn>current liquid store</dfn>.</p>

<p>An identifier cannot only name a type of syntax or a location, but
also a liquid location.  An identifier that names a liquid is called
a <dfn>liquid variable</dfn> or <dfn>liquid</dfn>, for short.

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>&langle;liquid&rangle;</b></p>

<p>An expression consisting of a liquid is a <dfn>liquid
reference</dfn>.  The value of the liquid reference is the value in
the current liquid environment for the liquid location named
by <var>liquid</var>.</p>

<p>If the current liquid environment does not contain a binding for
that liquid location, an exception with condition
type <code>&assertion</code> is raised.</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>set!</b> <b>&langle;liquid&rangle;</b></p>

<p>The <code>&langle;expression&rangle;</code> is evaluated, and the
current continuation replaced by an equivalent continuation except
that the liquid environment of its primordial continuation is extended
by binding the liquid location named by <var>liquid</var> to the value
of <var>expression</var>. The result of the <code>set!</code>
expression is unspecified.</p>

<p>If the current liquid environment does not contain a binding for
that liquid location, an exception with condition
type <code>&assertion</code> is raised.</p>

<p><u>Definition:</u> <b>define-liquid</b> <var>&langle;liquid&rangle;</var> [<var>expression</var>]</p>

<p>This definition binds <var>&langle;liquid&rangle;</var> to a fresh liquid location before the
<var>expression</var> is evaluated, and the current continuation
replaced by an equivalent continuation except that the liquid
environment of its primordial continuation is extended by binding the
fresh liquid location to the value of <var>expression</var>.

<p>the continuation of &langle;expression&rangle; should not be
invoked more than once.  Implementations may or may not detect that
the continuation of <var>expression</var> is invoked more than once.
However, if the implementation detects this, it must raise an
exception with condition type <code>&assertion</code>.</p>

<p>If the optional <var>expression</var> is not given, a
side-effect-free expression returning an unspecified value is used
instead.</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>let-liquid</b> ...</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b>liquid-let</b> ...</p>

<p>Please include examples.  They make it much easier for readers to
understand your proposal.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>A portable R<sup>6</sup>RS or R<sup>7</sup>RS Small implementation
is not possible.</p>

<p>The sample implementation is provided as
an <a href="https://github.com/mnieper/ChezScheme/tree/liquids">extension</a> to Chez Scheme.</p>
